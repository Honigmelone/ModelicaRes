ModelicaRes
-----------

[ModelicaRes] is a free, open-source tool to manage [Modelica] simulations,
interpret results, and create publishable figures.  It is possible to

- Auto-generate simulation scripts,
- Browse data,
- Perform custom calculations, and
- Produce various plots and diagrams.

![Sankey diagram of three tanks example](examples/ThreeTanks-small.png)

The figures are generated via [matplotlib], which
offers a rich set of plotting routines.  [ModelicaRes] includes convenient
functions to automatically pre-format and label some figures, like xy plots,
Bode and Nyquist plots, and Sankey diagrams.  [ModelicaRes] can be scripted or
run from a [Python] interpreter with math and matrix functions from [NumPy].

For more information, please see the [main project site] or the [doc](doc)
folder for the full documentation and many examples.

### Installation

The easiest way to install this package is to use 
[pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip):

    pip install modelicares

On Linux, it may be necessary to have root privileges:

    sudo pip install modelicares

Another way is to download and extract a copy of the package from the 
[main project site], the 
[master branch at GitHub](https://github.com/kdavies4/ModelicaRes), or the
[PyPI page](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ModelicaRes).  Run the following command 
from the base folder:

    python setup.py install

Or, on Linux:

    sudo python setup.py install

The [matplotlibrc](matplotlibrc) file has some recommended revisions to
[matplotlib]'s defaults.  To use it, move or copy it to the working directory or 
[matplotlib]'s configuration directory.  See
http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html for details.
